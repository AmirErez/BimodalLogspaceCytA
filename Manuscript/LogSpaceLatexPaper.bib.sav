  Abstract                 = {Maintenance of homeostasis in the immune system involves competition for resources between T lymphocytes, which avoids the development of immune pathology seen in lymphopenic mice. CD25+CD4+ T cells are important for homeostasis, but there is as yet no consensus on their mechanisms of action. Although CD25+CD4+ T cells cause substantial down-regulation of IL-2 mRNA in responder T cells in an in vitro co-culture system, the presence of IL- protein can be demonstrated by intracellular staining. As a consequence of competition for IL-2, CD25+CD4+ T cells further up-regulate the IL-2R α chain (CD25), a process that is strictly dependent on IL-2, whereas responder T cells fail to up-regulate CD25. Similarly, adoptive transfer into lymphopenic mice showed that CD25+CD4+ T cells interfere with CD25 up-regulation on co-transferred naive T cells, while increasing their own CD25 levels. IL-2 sequestration by CD25+CD4+ T cells is not a passive phenomenon but instead initiates—in conjunction with signals through the TCR—their differentiation to IL-10 production. Although IL-10 is not required for in vitro suppression, it is vital for the in vivo function of regulatory T cells. Our data provide a link explaining the apparent difference in regulatory mechanisms in vitro and in vivo.},

A continuum of transitional cell states exists between these discrete stages. We combine the depth of single-cell mass cytometry and an algorithm developed to leverage this continuum by aligning single cells of a given lineage onto a unified trajectory that accurately predicts the developmental path de novo. Applied to human B cell lymphopoiesis, the algorithm (termed Wanderlust) constructed trajectories spanning from hematopoietic stem cells through to naive B cells. This trajectory revealed nascent fractions of B cell progenitors and aligned them with developmentally cued regulatory signaling including IL-7/STAT5 and cellular events such as immunoglobulin rearrangement, highlighting checkpoints across which regulatory signals are rewired paralleling changes in cellular state. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of human B lymphopoiesis, laying a foundation to apply this approach to other tissues and “corrupted” developmental processes including cancer.},

This opinion article discusses the possibility of combining IL-2 with certain anti-IL-2 antibodies for reducing the dose of IL-2 needed and preferentially stimulating effector T cells, but not Tregs, an approach that might provide an improved strategy for anticancer immunotherapy. Alternatively, complexes of IL-2 with other anti-IL-2 antibodies can selectively stimulate Tregs and could, therefore, be useful for treating autoimmune diseases.},

  Abstract                 = {A population of cells exhibits wide phenotypic variation even if it is genetically homogeneous. In particular, individual cells differ from one another in the amount of protein they express under a given regulatory system under fixed conditions. Here we study how protein distributions in a population of the yeast S. cerevisiae are shaped by a balance of processes: protein production—an intracellular process—and protein dilution due to cell division—a population process. We measure protein distributions by employing reporter green fluorescence protein ( gfp ) under the regulation of the yeast GAL system under conditions where it is metabolically essential. Cell populations are grown in chemostats, thus allowing control of the environment and stable measurements of distribution dynamics over many generations. Despite the essential functional role of the GAL system in a pure galactose medium, steady-state distributions are found to be universally broad, with exponential tails and a large standard-deviation-to-mean ratio. Under several different perturbations the dynamics of the distribution is observed to be asymmetric, with a much longer time to build a wide expression distribution from below compared with a fast relaxation of the distribution toward steady state from above. These results show that the main features of the protein distributions are largely determined by population effects and are less sensitive to the intracellular biochemical noise.},

By means of in vivo fate mapping, we found a striking variability of immune responses derived from individual CD8+ T cells and show that robust acute and recall immunity requires the initial recruitment of multiple precursors. Unbiased mathematical modeling identifies the random integration of multiple differentiation and division events as the driving force behind this variability. Within this probabilistic framework, cell fate is specified along a linear developmental path that progresses from slowly proliferating long-lived to rapidly expanding short-lived subsets. These data provide insights into how complex biological systems implement stochastic processes to guarantee robust outcomes.},

  Abstract                 = {Cytokines are pleiotropic and readily diffusible messenger molecules, raising the question of how their action can be confined to specific target cells. The T cell cytokine interleukin-2 (IL-2) is essential for the homeostasis of regulatory T (Treg) cells that suppress (auto)immunity and stimulates immune responses mediated by conventional T cells. We combined mathematical modeling and experiments to dissect the dynamics of the IL-2 signaling network that links the prototypical IL-2 producers, conventional T helper (Th) cells, and Treg cells. We show how the IL-2-induced upregulation of high-affinity IL-2 receptors (IL-2R) establishes a positive feedback loop of IL-2 signaling. This feedback mediates a digital switch for the proliferation of Th cells and functions as an analog amplifier for the IL-2 uptake capacity of Treg cells. Unlike other positive feedbacks in cell signaling that augment signal propagation, the IL-2/IL-2R loop enhances the capture of the signal molecule and its degradation. Thus Treg and Th cells can compete for IL-2 and restrict its range of action through efficient cellular uptake. Depending on activation status and spatial localization of the cells, IL-2 may be consumed exclusively by Treg or Th cells, or be shared between them. In particular, a Treg cell can deprive a stimulated Th cell of its IL-2, but only when the cells are located in close proximity, within a few tens of micrometers. The present findings explain how IL-2 can play two disctinct roles in immune regulation and point to a hitherto largely unexplored spatiotemporal complexity of cytokine signaling.},

Whereas cells with increased abundance of the α subunit of the IL-2 receptor α (IL-2Rα) had an expected correlation with increased sensitivity to IL-2, they also exhibited an unexpected decrease in responsiveness to IL-7. Mathematical modeling predicted that increased IL-2Rα abundance would sequester the c chain from the IL-7Rα subunit, which would decrease the sensitivity of the T cells to IL-7. Further experiments validated this prediction. Changes in IL-2Rα abundance did not affect the signaling of other gamma-c family cytokines, which could be attributed to higher affinities between their receptor α subunits and the c chain.},

RA is faithful to experimental fact, while it plays out the action in animated formats directly accessible to the eye and mind. Most importantly, RA is analytical, interactive, and allows experimentation in silico. Here, we use RA to reveal unexpected emergent properties of thymocyte development. In particular, we now report that competition between thymocytes for sites of stimulation could be important in generating the fine anatomy of the thymus, in selecting for thymocytes with a range of migration velocities, and in explaining the paradox of CD4 to CD8 T cell lineage ratios. This study highlights the explanatory power and the potential aid to experimentation offered by an animated, interactive simulation of complex sets of data.</p>},

  Abstract                 = {Understanding how the immune system decides between tolerance and activation by antigens requires addressing cytokine regulation as a highly dynamic process. We quantified the dynamics of interleukin-2 (IL-2) signaling in a population of T cells during an immune response by combining in silico modeling and single-cell measurements in vitro. We demonstrate that IL-2 receptor expression levels vary widely among Tcells creating a large variability in the ability of the individual cells to consume, produce and participate in IL-2 signaling within the population. Our model reveals that at the population level, these heterogeneous cells are engaged in a tug-of-war for IL-2 between regulatory (Treg) and effector (Teff) T cells, whereby access to IL-2 can either increase the survival of Teff cells or the suppressive capacity of Treg cells. This tug-of-war is the mechanism enforcing, at the systems level, a core function of Treg cells, namely the specific suppression of survival signals for weakly activated Teff cells but not for strongly activated cells. Our integrated model yields quantitative, experimentally validated predictions for the manipulation of Treg suppression.},

  Abstract                 = {In T cells, the stochasticity of protein expression could contribute to the useful diversification of biological functions within a clonal population or interfere with accurate antigen discrimination. Combining computer modeling and single-cell measurements, we examined how endogenous variation in the expression levels of signaling proteins might affect antigen responsiveness during T cell activation. We found that the CD8 co-receptor fine-tunes activation thresholds, whereas the soluble hematopoietic phosphatase 1 (SHP-1) digitally regulates cell responsiveness. Stochastic variation in the expression of these proteins generates substantial diversity of activation within a clonal population of T cells, but co-regulation of CD8 and SHP-1 levels ultimately limits this very diversity. These findings reveal how eukaryotic cells can draw on regulated variation in gene expression to achieve phenotypic variability in a controlled manner.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND:Three networks of intercellular communication can be associated with cytokine secretion; one limited to cells of the immune system (immune cells), one limited to parenchymal cells of organs and tissues (body cells), and one involving interactions between immune and body cells (immune-body interface). These cytokine connections determine the inflammatory response to injury and subsequent healing as well as the biologic consequences of the adaptive immune response to antigens. We informatically probed the cytokine database to uncover the underlying network architecture of the three networks.RESULTS:We now report that the three cytokine networks are among the densest of complex networks yet studied, and each features a characteristic profile of specific three-cell motifs. Some legitimate cytokine connections are shunned (anti-motifs). Certain immune cells can be paired by their input-output positions in a cytokine architecture tree of five tiers: macrophages (MPhi) and B cells (BC) comprise the first tier; the second tier is formed by T helper 1 (Th1) and T helper 2 (Th2) cells; the third tier includes dendritic cells (DC), mast cells (MAST), Natural Killer T cells (NK-T) and others; the fourth tier is formed by neutrophils (NEUT) and Natural Killer cells (NK); and the Cytotoxic T cell (CTL) stand alone as a fifth tier. The three-cell cytokine motif architecture of immune system cells places the immune system in a super-family that includes social networks and the World Wide Web. Body cells are less clearly stratified, although cells involved in wound healing and angiogenesis are most highly interconnected with immune cells.CONCLUSION:Cytokine network architecture creates an innate cell-communication platform that organizes the biologic outcome of antigen recognition and inflammation. Informatics sheds new light on immune-body systems organization.REVIEWERS:This article was reviewed by Neil Greenspan, Matthias von Herrath and Anne Cooke.},

We show that the steady-state distribution tail is determined by a combination of protein production and cell division and is insensitive to other model details. Under general conditions this tail is exponential with a dependence on parameters consistent with experiment.

  Abstract                 = {Bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) is widely used in immunology to detect cell division, and several mathematical models have been proposed to estimate proliferation and death rates of lymphocytes from BrdU labelling and de-labelling curves. One problem in interpreting BrdU data is explaining the de-labelling curves. Because shortly after label withdrawal, BrdU+ cells are expected to divide into BrdU+ daughter cells, one would expect a flat down-slope. As for many cell types, the fraction of BrdU+ cells decreases during de-labelling, previous mathematical models had to make debatable assumptions to be able to account for the data. We develop a mechanistic model tracking the number of divisions that each cell has undergone in the presence and absence of BrdU, and allow cells to accumulate and dilute their BrdU content. From the same mechanistic model, one can naturally derive expressions for the mean BrdU content (MBC) of all cells, or the MBC of the BrdU+ subset, which is related to the mean fluorescence intensity of BrdU that can be measured in experiments. The model is extended to include subpopulations with different rates of division and death (i.e. kinetic heterogeneity). We fit the extended model to previously published BrdU data from memory T lymphocytes in simian immunodeficiency virus-infected and uninfected macaques, and find that the model describes the data with at least the same quality as previous models. Because the same model predicts a modest decline in the MBC of BrdU+ cells, which is consistent with experimental observations, BrdU dilution seems a natural explanation for the observed down-slopes in self-renewing populations.},

  Abstract                 = {<title>Author Summary</title> <p>In order to perform complex functions upon pathogenic challenges, the immune system needs to efficiently deploy a repertoire of specialized cells by inducing the differentiation of precursor cells into effector cells. In a critical process of the adaptive immune system, one common type of precursor cell can give rise to both T helper 17 cells and regulatory T cells, which have distinct phenotypes and functions. Recent discoveries have revealed a certain heterogeneity in this reciprocal differentiation system. In particular, treating precursor cells with a single differentiation signal can result in a remarkably diverse population. An understanding of such variable responses is limited by a lack of quantitative models. Our mathematical model of this cell differentiation system reveals how the control system generates phenotypic diversity and how its final state can be regulated by various signals. The model suggests a new quantitative explanation for the scenario in which the master regulators of two different T cell lineages can be highly expressed in a single cell. The model provides a new framework for understanding the dynamic properties of this type of regulatory network and the mechanisms that help to maintain a balance of effector cells during the inflammatory response to infection.</p>},

We derive a relation between the long-term growth rate of the organism and the information available about its fluctuating environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Effector T cell responses rely on a phenotypically and functionally heterogeneous population of cells. Whether this diversity is programmed before clonal expansion or in later phases as a result of stochastic events or asymmetric cell division is not fully understood. In this study, we first took advantage of a sensitive in vitro assay to analyze the composition of single CD8+ T cell progenies. Heterogeneity was predominantly observed between progenies of distinct clones, but could also be detected within individual progenies. Furthermore, by physically isolating daughter cells of the first T cell division, we showed that differences in paired daughter cell progenies contributed to intraclonal diversification. Finally, we developed an in vivo limiting dilution assay to compare individual T cell progenies following immunization. We provided evidence for simultaneous intraclonal and interclonal diversification in vivo. Our results support the idea that T cell diversification is a continuous process, initiated before clonal expansion and amplified during the first and subsequent cell divisions.},

  Abstract                 = {Gut mucosal homeostasis depends on complex interactions among the microbiota, the intestinal epithelium, and the gut associated immune system. A breakdown in some of these interactions may precipitate inflammation. Inflammatory bowel diseases, Crohn’s disease, and ulcerative colitis are chronic inflammatory disorders of the gastrointestinal tract. The initial stages of disease are marked by an abnormally high level of pro-inflammatory helper T cells, Th1. In later stages, Th2 helper cells may dominate while the Th1 response may dampen. The interaction among the T cells includes the regulatory T cells (Treg). The present paper develops a mathematical model by a system of differential equations with terms nonlocal in the space spanned by the concentrations of cytokines that represents the interaction among T cells through a cytokine signaling network. The model demonstrates how the abnormal levels of T cells observed in inflammatory bowel diseases can arise from abnormal regulation of Th1 and Th2 cells by Treg cells.},

  Abstract                 = {This text is addressed to both the beginner and the seasoned professional, geology being used as the main but not the sole illustration. The goal is to present an alternative approach to multifractals, extending and streamlining the original approach inMandelbrot (1974). The generalization from fractal sets to multifractal measures involves the passage from geometric objects that are characterized primarily by one number, namely a fractal dimension, to geometric objects that are characterized primarily by a function. The best is to choose the function ?(a), which is a limit probability distribution that has been plotted suitably, on double logarithmic scales. The quantity a is called Hölder exponent. In terms of the alternative function f (a) used in the approach of Frisch-Parisi and of Halsey et al. , one has ?(a)= f (a)- E for measures supported by the Euclidean space of dimension E . When f (a)=0, f (a) is a fractal dimension. However, one may have f (a) D q , which is shown for q &gt;1 to be a critical dimension for the cuts. An “enhanced multifractal diagram” is drawn, including f (a), a function called t( q ) and D q .},

  Abstract                 = {Immunological studies frequently analyze individual components (e.g., signaling pathways) of immune systems in a reductionist manner. In contrast, systems immunology aims to give a synthetic understanding of how these components function together as a whole. While immunological research involves in vivo and in vitro experiments, systems immunology research can also be conducted in silico. With an increasing interest in systems-level studies spawned by high-throughput technologies, many immunologists are looking forward to insights provided by computational modeling and simulation. However, modeling and simulation research has mainly been conducted in computational fields, and therefore, little material is available or accessible to immunologists today. This survey is an attempt at bridging the gap between immunologists and systems immunology modeling and simulation. Modeling and simulation refer to building and executing an in silico replica of an immune system. Models are specified within a mathematical or algorithmic framework called formalism and then implemented using software tools. A plethora of modeling formalisms and software tools are reported in the literature for systems immunology. However, it is difficult for a new entrant to the field to know which of these would be suitable for modeling an immunological application at hand. This paper covers three aspects. First, it introduces the field of system immunology emphasizing on the modeling and simulation components. Second, it gives an overview of the principal modeling formalisms, each of which is illustrated with salient applications in immunological research. This overview of formalisms and applications is conducted not only to illustrate their power but also to serve as a reference to assist immunologists in choosing the best formalism for the problem at hand. Third, it lists major software tools, which can be used to practically implement models in these formalisms. Combined, these aspects can help immunologists to start experimenting with in silico models. Finally, future research directions are discussed. Particularly, we identify integrative frameworks to facilitate the coupling of different modeling formalisms and modeling the adaptation properties through evolution of immune systems as the next key research efforts necessary to further develop the multidisciplinary field of systems immunology.},

As reductionist in vitro approaches have been instrumental in the elucidation of the factors determining the development of helper T cells, in this perspective we highlight the need for the standardization of protocols, also fundamental for the comparison of immune responses in mice and humans. Improving understanding of how these in vitro quantitative events translate to immune responses in vivo, which can be studied in mouse models, is of importance in obtaining information on immune responses in humans, thus empowering translational research.},

Upregulation of IL-17 cytokines in Tresp cells was dependent on consumption of IL-2 by Treg cells, especially at early time points both in vitro and in vivo. During an oral Candida albicans infection in mice, Treg cells induced IL-17 cytokines in Tresp cells, which markedly enhanced fungal clearance and recovery from infection. These findings show how Treg cells can promote acute Th17 cell responses to suppress mucosal fungus infections and reveal that Treg cells have a powerful capability to fight infections besides their role in maintaining tolerance or immune homeostasis. Treg cells boost IL-17 cytokines in Th17 cells by consuming IL-2 in vitro and in vivo Treg cells enhance acute Th17 cell response against Candida albicans Treg cells inhibit Th17 cells in a delayed manner in model of IBD},

Treg cells did not affect the early activation or proliferation of effector CD4+ T cells. Cytokines that signal through the common gamma-chain suppressed Treg cell–induced apoptosis. Treg cell–induced effector CD4+ T cell death required the proapoptotic protein Bim, and effector CD4+ T cells incubated with Treg cells showed less activation of the prosurvival kinase Akt and less phosphorylation of the proapoptotic protein Bad.

It is puzzling that interferon-γ induces the Th1 transcription factor T-bet, whereas interleukin-12 mediates Th1 cell lineage differentiation. We use mathematical modeling to analyze the expression kinetics of T-bet, interferon-γ, and the IL-12 receptor β2 chain (IL-12Rβ2) during Th1 cell differentiation, in the presence or absence of interleukin-12 or interferon-γ signaling. We show that interferon-γ induced initial T-bet expression, whereas IL-12Rβ2 was repressed by T cell receptor (TCR) signaling. The termination of TCR signaling permitted upregulation of IL-12Rβ2 by T-bet and interleukin-12 signaling that maintained T-bet expression. This late expression of T-bet, accompanied by the upregulation of the transcription factors Runx3 and Hlx, was required to imprint the Th cell for interferon-γ re-expression. Thus initial polarization and subsequent imprinting of Th1 cells are mediated by interlinked, sequentially acting positive feedback loops of TCR-interferon-γ-Stat1-T-bet and interleukin-12-Stat4-T-bet signaling.},

Each cell type plays a distinct role and communicates with other cell types through mediators such as cytokines, chemokines and hormones, among others, that are crucial for the functioning of the IS and its fine tuning. Nevertheless, a quantitative analysis of the topological properties of an immunological network involving this complex interchange of mediators among immune cells is still lacking.Results: Here we present a method for quantifying the relevance of different mediators in the immune network, which exploits a definition of centrality based on the concept of efficient communication. The analysis, applied to the human IS, indicates that its mediators differ significantly in their network relevance. We found that cytokines involved in innate immunity and inflammation and some hormones rank highest in the network, revealing that the most prominent mediators of the IS are molecules involved in these ancestral types of defence mechanisms which are highly integrated with the adaptive immune response, and at the interplay among the nervous, the endocrine and the immune systems.Contact: claudio.franceschi@unibo.it},

  Abstract                 = {Over the past decade, the biomathematical community has devoted substantial effort to the complicated challenge of estimating parameter values for biological systems models. An even more difficult issue is the characterization of functional forms for the processes that govern these systems. Most parameter estimation approaches tacitly assume that these forms are known or can be assumed with some validity. However, this assumption is not always true. The recently proposed method of Dynamic Flux Estimation (DFE) addresses this problem in a genuinely novel fashion for metabolic pathway systems. Specifically, DFE allows the characterization of fluxes within such systems through an analysis of metabolic time series data. Its main drawback is the fact that DFE can only directly be applied if the pathway system contains as many metabolites as unknown fluxes. This situation is unfortunately rare. To overcome this roadblock, earlier work in this field had proposed strategies for augmenting the set of unknown fluxes with independent kinetic information, which however is not always available. Employing Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse methods of linear algebra, the present article discusses an approach for characterizing fluxes from metabolic time series data that is applicable even if the pathway system is underdetermined and contains more fluxes than metabolites. Intriguingly, this approach is independent of a specific modeling framework and unaffected by noise in the experimental time series data. The results reveal whether any fluxes may be characterized and, if so, which subset is characterizable. They also help with the identification of fluxes that, if they could be determined independently, would allow the application of DFE.},

  Abstract                 = {Although interleukin-2 (IL-2) was initially characterized as the primary T-cell growth factor following in vitro activation1, less is known about its role in shaping T-cell responses to acute infections in vivo. The use of IL-2- or IL-2-receptor-deficient mice is problematic owing to their early development of autoimmunity2, 3, 4, 5, attributable to the central role of IL-2 in the generation, maintenance and function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells6, 7, 8, 9. To bypass these inherent difficulties, we have studied the effect of IL-2 on T-cell responses to acute infections by adopting a mixed chimaera strategy in which T cells lacking the high-affinity IL-2 receptor could be studied in an otherwise healthy mouse containing a full complement of regulatory T cells. Here we show that although IL-2 signalling to pathogen-specific CD8+ T cells affects the number of developing effector and memory cells very little, it is required for the generation of robust secondary responses. This is not due to an altered T-cell-receptor repertoire development or selection, and does not reflect an acute requirement for IL-2 during secondary activation and expansion. Rather, we demonstrate a previously unappreciated role for IL-2 during primary infection in programming the development of CD8+ memory T cells capable of full secondary expansion. These results have important implications for the development of vaccination or immunotherapeutic strategies aimed at boosting memory T-cell function.},

  abstract = {The origin and turnover of efferent populations of mouse mononuclear phagocytes has been described. Mononuclear phagocytes were defined as mononuclear cells which are able to adhere to glass and phagocytize. In vitro labeling studies with thymidine-3H showed that monocytes in the peripheral blood and peritoneal macrophages do not multiply and can be considered end cells in a normal, steady state situation. However, the mononuclear phagocytes of the bone marrow appear to be rapidly dividing cells. This conclusion was supported by in vivo labeling experiments. A peak of labeled mononuclear phagocytes of the bone marrow was found 24 hr after a pulse of thymidine-3H. This was followed, 24 hr later, by a peak of labeled monocytes in the peripheral blood. From these experiments it was concluded that the rapidly dividing mononuclear phagocytes of the bone marrow, called promonocytes, are the progenitor cells of the monocytes. Labeling studies after splenectomy and after X-irradiation excluded other organs as a major source of the monocytes. Peak labeling of both the blood monocyte and peritoneal macrophages occurred at the same time. A rapid entry of monocytes from the blood into the peritoneal cavity was observed, after a sterile inflammation was evoked by an injection of newborn calf serum. These data have led to the conclusion that monocytes give rise to peritoneal macrophages. No indications have been obtained that mononuclear phagocytes originate from lymphocytes. In the normal steady state the monocytes leave the circulation by a random process, with a half-time of 22 hr. The average blood transit time of the monocytes has been calculated to be 32 hr. The turnover rate of peritoneal macrophages was low and estimated at about 0.1% per hour. On the basis of these studies the life history of mouse mononuclear phagocytes was formulated to be: promonocytes in the bone marrow, → monocytes in the peripheral blood, → macrophages in the tissue.},

These experiments, complemented by data on expression profiles, mouse mutants, and humans with hematopoietic defects, are the foundation for the current hematopoietic differentiation tree. However, there are fundamental gaps in our knowledge of the quantitative and qualitative operation of the HSC/progenitor system under physiological and pathological conditions in vivo. The hallmarks of HSCs, self-renewal and multipotency, are observed in in vitro assays and cell transplantation experiments; however, the extent to which these features occur naturally in HSCs and progenitors remains uncertain.

  abstract  = {Background:In immunofluorescence measurements and most other flow cytometry applications, fluorescence signals of interest can range down to essentially zero. After fluorescence compensation, some cell populations will have low means and include events with negative data values. Logarithmic presentation has been very useful in providing informative displays of wide-ranging flow cytometry data, but it fails to adequately display cell populations with low means and high variances and, in particular, offers no way to include negative data values. This has led to a great deal of difficulty in interpreting and understanding flow cytometry data, has often resulted in incorrect delineation of cell populations, and has led many people to question the correctness of compensation computations that were, in fact, correct.Results:We identified a set of criteria for creating data visualization methods that accommodate the scaling difficulties presented by flow cytometry data. On the basis of these, we developed a new data visualization method that provides important advantages over linear or logarithmic scaling for display of flow cytometry data, a scaling we refer to as “Logicle” scaling. Logicle functions represent a particular generalization of the hyperbolic sine function with one more adjustable parameter than linear or logarithmic functions. Finally, we developed methods for objectively and automatically selecting an appropriate value for this parameter.Conclusions:The Logicle display method provides more complete, appropriate, and readily interpretable representations of data that includes populations with low-to-zero means, including distributions resulting from fluorescence compensation procedures, than can be produced using either logarithmic or linear displays. The method includes a specific algorithm for evaluating actual data distributions and deriving parameters of the Logicle scaling function appropriate for optimal display of that data. It is critical to note that Logicle visualization does not change the data values or the descriptive statistics computed from them. © 2006 International Society for Analytical Cytology},

The long-standing success of the log transform was its ability to stabilize linearly increasing gain-dependent uncertainties and the success of the log-like transforms is that they extend this notion to include zero and negative measurement values. This study derives and examines a transform called VLog that stabilizes the three general sources of variability: (1) gain-dependent variability, (2) photo-electron counting error, and (3) signal-independent sources of error. Somewhat surprisingly, this transform has a closed-form solution and therefore is relatively simple to implement. By including some quantitation elements in its formulation, the shape-dependent arguments, α and β, usually do not require optimization for different datasets. The simplicity and generality of the transform may make it a useful tool for cytometry and possibly other technologies. © 2016 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

  abstract = {In a high throughput setting, effective flow cytometry data analysis depends heavily on proper data preprocessing. While usual preprocessing steps of quality assessment, outlier removal, normalization, and gating have received considerable scrutiny from the community, the influence of data transformation on the output of high throughput analysis has been largely overlooked. Flow cytometry measurements can vary over several orders of magnitude, cell populations can have variances that depend on their mean fluorescence intensities, and may exhibit heavily-skewed distributions. Consequently, the choice of data transformation can influence the output of automated gating. An appropriate data transformation aids in data visualization and gating of cell populations across the range of data. Experience shows that the choice of transformation is data specific. Our goal here is to compare the performance of different transformations applied to flow cytometry data in the context of automated gating in a high throughput, fully automated setting. We examine the most common transformations used in flow cytometry, including the generalized hyperbolic arcsine, biexponential, linlog, and generalized Box-Cox, all within the BioConductor flowCore framework that is widely used in high throughput, automated flow cytometry data analysis. All of these transformations have adjustable parameters whose effects upon the data are non-intuitive for most users. By making some modelling assumptions about the transformed data, we develop maximum likelihood criteria to optimize parameter choice for these different transformations.},

  abstract  = {Flow cytometry data analysis routinely includes the use of one- or two-parameter histograms to visualize the data. These histograms have traditionally been plotted with either a linear or logarithmic scale. However, the recent trend of performing the logarithmic conversion in software has made apparent some limitations of the traditional visual presentation of logarithmic data. This review discusses the mathematics of presenting data on a histogram and emphasizes the difference between scaling and binning. The review introduces the concept of an effective resolution to describe how the bin width changes in a variable bin-width histogram. The change in effective resolution is used to explain the commonly observed valley and picket fencing artifacts. These result from the effective resolution of the display histogram being too high for the data being presented. Recently, several different binning transformations have been described that are becoming more popular because they allow one to view a large dynamic range of data on a single plot, while allowing the display of negative data values. While each of the transforms is based upon different equations, they all exhibit very similar properties. All of the transforms bin the data logarithmically at high channel values and linearly at low channel values. The linear scaling of the lower channels serves to limit the effective resolution of the histogram, thus minimizing the valley and picket fencing artifacts. The newer transformations are not without their own limitations and recommendations for the appropriate manner of presenting flow cytometry data using these newer transformations are discussed. © 2008 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},

(2) For enzymatic dose-inhibition curves, Hill coefficients smaller than one do not indicate anticooperative binding but show that at least one ternary complex has enzymatic activity. (3) Hill coefficients different from one are proof for multiple ligand binding. The large variations of reported Hill coefficients corresponds to multiple allosteric binding, where induced conformational changes cause loss of the active conformation. Such a denaturation mechanism is in stark contrast to the desired specificity of drugs. The discussion is open.},

  abstract  = {Flow cytometry bioinformatics is the application of bioinformatics to flow cytometry data, which involves storing, retrieving, organizing, and analyzing flow cytometry data using extensive computational resources and tools. Flow cytometry bioinformatics requires extensive use of and contributes to the development of techniques from computational statistics and machine learning. Flow cytometry and related methods allow the quantification of multiple independent biomarkers on large numbers of single cells. The rapid growth in the multidimensionality and throughput of flow cytometry data, particularly in the 2000s, has led to the creation of a variety of computational analysis methods, data standards, and public databases for the sharing of results. Computational methods exist to assist in the preprocessing of flow cytometry data, identifying cell populations within it, matching those cell populations across samples, and performing diagnosis and discovery using the results of previous steps. For preprocessing, this includes compensating for spectral overlap, transforming data onto scales conducive to visualization and analysis, assessing data for quality, and normalizing data across samples and experiments. For population identification, tools are available to aid traditional manual identification of populations in two-dimensional scatter plots (gating), to use dimensionality reduction to aid gating, and to find populations automatically in higher dimensional space in a variety of ways. It is also possible to characterize data in more comprehensive ways, such as the density-guided binary space partitioning technique known as probability binning, or by combinatorial gating. Finally, diagnosis using flow cytometry data can be aided by supervised learning techniques, and discovery of new cell types of biological importance by high-throughput statistical methods, as part of pipelines incorporating all of the aforementioned methods. Open standards, data, and software are also key parts of flow cytometry bioinformatics. Data standards include the widely adopted Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) defining how data from cytometers should be stored, but also several new standards under development by the International Society for Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC) to aid in storing more detailed information about experimental design and analytical steps. Open data is slowly growing with the opening of the CytoBank database in 2010 and FlowRepository in 2012, both of which allow users to freely distribute their data, and the latter of which has been recommended as the preferred repository for MIFlowCyt-compliant data by ISAC. Open software is most widely available in the form of a suite of Bioconductor packages, but is also available for web execution on the GenePattern platform.},

Cytofkit provides functions for data pre-processing, data visualization through linear or non-linear dimensionality reduction, automatic identification of cell subsets, and inference of the relatedness between cell subsets. This pipeline also provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for ease of use, as well as a shiny application (APP) for interactive visualization of cell subpopulations and progression profiles of key markers. Applied to a CD14−CD19− PBMCs dataset, cytofkit accurately identified different subsets of lymphocytes; applied to a human CD4+ T cell dataset, cytofkit uncovered multiple subtypes of TFH cells spanning blood and tonsils. Cytofkit is implemented in R, licensed under the Artistic license 2.0, and freely available from the Bioconductor website, https://bioconductor.org/packages/cytofkit/.

  abstract  = {Flow cytometry is used increasingly in clinical research for cancer, immunology and vaccines. Technological advances in cytometry instrumentation are increasing the size and dimensionality of data sets, posing a challenge for traditional data management and analysis. Automated analysis methods, despite a general consensus of their importance to the future of the field, have been slow to gain widespread adoption. Here we present OpenCyto, a new BioConductor infrastructure and data analysis framework designed to lower the barrier of entry to automated flow data analysis algorithms by addressing key areas that we believe have held back wider adoption of automated approaches. OpenCyto supports end-to-end data analysis that is robust and reproducible while generating results that are easy to interpret. We have improved the existing, widely used core BioConductor flow cytometry infrastructure by allowing analysis to scale in a memory efficient manner to the large flow data sets that arise in clinical trials, and integrating domain-specific knowledge as part of the pipeline through the hierarchical relationships among cell populations. Pipelines are defined through a text-based csv file, limiting the need to write data-specific code, and are data agnostic to simplify repetitive analysis for core facilities. We demonstrate how to analyze two large cytometry data sets: an intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) data set from a published HIV vaccine trial focused on detecting rare, antigen-specific T-cell populations, where we identify a new subset of CD8 T-cells with a vaccine-regimen specific response that could not be identified through manual analysis, and a CyTOF T-cell phenotyping data set where a large staining panel and many cell populations are a challenge for traditional analysis. The substantial improvements to the core BioConductor flow cytometry packages give OpenCyto the potential for wide adoption. It can rapidly leverage new developments in computational cytometry and facilitate reproducible analysis in a unified environment.},

  abstract  = {Author Summary The use of flow cytometry to count antigen-specific T cells is essential for vaccine development, monitoring of immune-based therapies and immune biomarker discovery. Analysis of such data is challenging because antigen-specific cells are often present in frequencies of less than 1 in 1,000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). Standard analysis of flow cytometry data relies on visual identification of cell subsets by experts, a process that is subjective and often difficult to reproduce. Consequently, there is intense interest in automated approaches for cell subset identification. One popular class of such automated approaches is the use of statistical mixture models. We propose a hierarchical extension of statistical mixture models that has two advantages over standard mixture models. First, it increases the ability to detect extremely rare event clusters that are present in multiple samples. Second, it enables direct comparison of cell subsets by aligning clusters across multiple samples in a natural way arising from the hierarchical formulation. We demonstrate the algorithm on clinically relevant reference PBMC samples with known frequencies of CD8 T cells engineered to express T cell receptors specific for the cancer-testis antigen (NY-ESO-1) and compare its performance with other popular automated analysis approaches.},

There is growing recognition that abnormal progression through the cell cycle and the associated effects on the growth of cell populations has a major impact on a wide range of biological and clinical problems, including: tumour growth, developmental control, origins of chromosomal instability and drug resistance. Multiparameter flow cytometry is frequently used to assess proliferation dynamics of cellular populations using fluorescent reporters generating large data sets that can inform simulation models. We have developed stochastic computing approaches allied to evolutionary algorithms to produce simulated cell populations--providing a new approach to the analysis of real multi-variate data sets obtained by flow cytometry. The methodology delivers new insight on biological processes in delivering a continuous simulation of the dynamic evolution of a cellular system between fixed sampling points, hence, converting static data into dynamic data revealing the effective traverse of the cell cycle, restriction points and commitment gateways. The approach also permits the visualisation of the variation between individual cells reflecting biological heterogeneity and potentially Darwinian fitness, given that the simulation delivers a report on population dynamics in which each and every cell can be tracked.},

This study proposes a data-driven gating strategy, CCAST, for sorting out homogeneous subpopulations from a heterogeneous population of single cells without relying on expert knowledge thereby removing human bias and variability. In a fully automated manner, CCAST identifies the relevant gating markers, gating hierarchy and partitions that isolate homogeneous cell subpopulations. CCAST is optimized for cell sorting but can be applied to the identification and analysis of homogeneous subpopulations. CCAST is shown to identify more homogeneous breast cancer subpopulations in SUM159 compared to prior sorting strategies. When applied to normal bone marrow single cell data, CCAST proposes an efficient strategy for gating out T-cells without relying on expert knowledge; on B-cells, it reveals a new characterization of mature B-cell subtypes not revealed by manual gating.},

  abstract  = {Most tasks require a person or an automated system to reason -- to reach conclusions based on available information. The framework of probabilistic graphical models, presented in this book, provides a general approach for this task. The approach is model-based, allowing interpretable models to be constructed and then manipulated by reasoning algorithms. These models can also be learned automatically from data, allowing the approach to be used in cases where manually constructing a model is difficult or even impossible. Because uncertainty is an inescapable aspect of most real-world applications, the book focuses on probabilistic models, which make the uncertainty explicit and provide models that are more faithful to reality.  Probabilistic Graphical Models discusses a variety of models, spanning Bayesian networks, undirected Markov networks, discrete and continuous models, and extensions to deal with dynamical systems and relational data. For each class of models, the text describes the three fundamental cornerstones: representation, inference, and learning, presenting both basic concepts and advanced techniques. Finally, the book considers the use of the proposed framework for causal reasoning and decision making under uncertainty. The main text in each chapter provides the detailed technical development of the key ideas. Most chapters also include boxes with additional material: skill boxes, which describe techniques; case study boxes, which discuss empirical cases related to the approach described in the text, including applications in computer vision, robotics, natural language understanding, and computational biology; and concept boxes, which present significant concepts drawn from the material in the chapter. Instructors (and readers) can group chapters in various combinations, from core topics to more technically advanced material, to suit their particular needs.},

The Bayesian paradigm allows for probability statements to be made directly about the unknown parameters, prior or expert opinion to be included in the analysis, and hierarchical descriptions of both local-scale and global features of the model. This chapter aims to introduce the prior modeling, estimation, and evaluation of mixture distributions in a Bayesian paradigm. The chapter shows that mixture distributions provide a flexible, parametric framework for statistical modeling and analysis. Focus is on the methods rather than advanced examples, in the hope that an understanding of the practical aspects of such modeling can be carried into many disciplines. It also points out the fundamental difficulty in doing inference with such objects, along with a discussion about prior modeling, which is more restrictive than usual, and the constructions of estimators, which also is more involved than the standard posterior mean solution. Finally, this chapter gives some pointers to the related models and problems like mixtures of regressions and hidden Markov models as well as Dirichlet priors.},

In mammalian cells, protein levels also vary8, 9, 10 and individual cells differ widely in their responsiveness to uniform physiological stimuli11, 12, 13, 14, 15. In the case of apoptosis mediated by TRAIL (tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) it is common for some cells in a clonal population to die while others survive—a striking divergence in cell fate. Among cells that die, the time between TRAIL exposure and caspase activation is highly variable. Here we image sister cells expressing reporters of caspase activation and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization after exposure to TRAIL. We show that naturally occurring differences in the levels or states of proteins regulating receptor-mediated apoptosis are the primary causes of cell-to-cell variability in the timing and probability of death in human cell lines. Protein state is transmitted from mother to daughter, giving rise to transient heritability in fate, but protein synthesis promotes rapid divergence so that sister cells soon become no more similar to each other than pairs of cells chosen at random. Our results have implications for understanding ‘fractional killing’ of tumour cells after exposure to chemotherapy, and for variability in mammalian signal transduction in general.},

  abstract = {The different cell types in a living organism acquire their identity through the process of cell differentiation in which multipotent progenitor cells differentiate into distinct cell types. Experimental evidence and analysis of large-scale microarray data establish the key role played by a two-gene motif in cell differentiation in a number of cell systems. The two genes express transcription factors which repress each otherʼs expression and autoactivate their own production. A number of theoretical models have recently been proposed based on the two-gene motif to provide a physical understanding of how cell differentiation occurs. In this paper, we study a simple model of cell differentiation which assumes no cooperativity in the regulation of gene expression by the transcription factors. The latter repress each otherʼs activity directly through DNA binding and indirectly through the formation of heterodimers. We specifically investigate how deterministic processes combined with stochasticity contribute in bringing about cell differentiation. The deterministic dynamics of our model give rise to a supercritical pitchfork bifurcation from an undifferentiated stable steady state to two differentiated stable steady states. The stochastic dynamics of our model are studied using the approaches based on the Langevin equations and the linear noise approximation. The simulation results provide a new physical understanding of recent experimental observations. We further propose experimental measurements of quantities like the variance and the lag-1 autocorrelation function in protein fluctuations as the early signatures of an approaching bifurcation point in the cell differentiation process.},

  abstract  = {Author Summary A certain type of multipotent progenitor cell of the blood can commit to either the white (myeloid) or the red (erythroid) blood cell lineage, thus making a discrete binary cell fate decision. To test a theory on fundamental principles of cell fate dynamics (as opposed to the usually studied molecular mechanisms), we monitored such a fate decision in vitro using single-cell resolution gene expression analysis. We found that blood progenitor cells undergoing a fate decision to commit to either lineage after treatment with fate-determining cytokines, according to theory, first destabilized their original state. Cell states hereby diversified, manifesting the predicted flattening of an attractor’s potential well, which allows the increasingly vacillating progenitor cells to “spill” into adjacent potential wells corresponding to either lineage--myeloid or erythroid. This destabilization of an old stable state until suddenly opening access to new stable states is consistent with a critical transition (tipping point). We propose and demonstrate a new type of early warning signal that precedes critical transitions: an index IC based on a change in the high-dimensional cell population structure obtained from single-cell resolution measurements. This index may be used to predict imminent tipping point-like transitions in multicell systems, e.g., before pathological changes in tissues.},

  abstract  = {Single-cell RNA and protein concentrations dynamically fluctuate because of stochastic ("noisy") regulation. Consequently, biological signaling and genetic networks not only translate stimuli with functional response but also random fluctuations. Intuitively, this feature manifests as the accumulation of fluctuations from the network source to the target. Taking advantage of the fact that noise propagates directionally, we developed a method for causation prediction that does not require time-lagged observations and therefore can be applied to data generated by destructive assays such as immunohistochemistry. Our method for causation prediction, "Inference of Network Directionality Using Covariance Elements (INDUCE)," exploits the theoretical relationship between a change in the strength of a causal interaction and the associated changes in the single cell measured entries of the covariance matrix of protein concentrations. We validated our method for causation prediction in two experimental systems where causation is well established: in an E. coli synthetic gene network, and in MEK to ERK signaling in mammalian cells. We report the first analysis of covariance elements documenting noise propagation from a kinase to a phosphorylated substrate in an endogenous mammalian signaling network.},

  abstract = {Summary Activation of Ras proteins underlies functional decisions in diverse cell types. Two molecules, RasGRP and SOS, catalyze Ras activation in lymphocytes. Binding of active Ras to SOS' allosteric pocket markedly increases SOS' activity establishing a positive feedback loop for SOS-mediated Ras activation. Integrating in silico and in vitro studies, we demonstrate that digital signaling in lymphocytes (cells are “on” or “off”) is predicated upon feedback regulation of SOS. SOS' feedback loop leads to hysteresis in the dose-response curve, which can enable a capacity to sustain Ras activation as stimuli are withdrawn and exhibit “memory” of past encounters with antigen. Ras activation via RasGRP alone is analog (graded increase in amplitude with stimulus). We describe how complementary analog (RasGRP) and digital (SOS) pathways act on Ras to efficiently convert analog input to digital output. Numerous predictions regarding the impact of our findings on lymphocyte function and development are noted.},

This provides information about the strength and shape of modes and can also be used as a significance test. We use a data-splitting approach in which potential modes are identified by using the first half of the data and inference is done with the second half of the data. To obtain valid confidence sets for the eigenvalues, we use a bootstrap based on an elementary symmetric polynomial transformation. This leads to valid bootstrap confidence sets regardless of any multiplicities in the eigenvalues. We also suggest a new method for bandwidth selection, namely choosing the bandwidth to maximize the number of significant modes. We show by example that this method works well. Even when the true distribution is singular, and hence does not have a density (in which case cross-validation chooses a zero bandwidth), our method chooses a reasonable bandwidth.},

We show that dip and bandwidth tests for unimodality, taken from the statistics literature, can do this with consistent and low error rates. These tests also have the possibility to adjust the significance level to handle the trade-off between failing to detect a second mode and seeing a second mode when there is none. The differences between the dip and bandwidth tests are elucidated using real data from the FlowCAP I challenge, also guidelines for flow cytometry data preprocessing are given. © 2017 International Society for Advancement of Cytometry},
